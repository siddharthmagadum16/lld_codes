Design a Music Player like Spotify with below methods 

 int addSong(string songTitle); // add a song to your music player with incremental song ids starting from 1  

void playSong(int songId, int userId); // user plays a song that is present in the music player  

void printMostPlayedSongs(); // print song titles in decreasing order of number of unique users' plays  


Follow up 

vector getLastThreeSongs(int userId); // get last 3 unique songs played by a given user  

There was another follow up as well. 

Then they asked a follow up to add a feature to star/unstar song(s) for a user and get last N favourite songs played(something like that).
